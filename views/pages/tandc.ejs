                However, Better You reserves the right of refusal and cancelation of an order at any given time for

                not inform you. We have the right to cancel or refuse delivery even if you have paid in case the product
                is mispriced or
                not showed correctly, we will compensate for the charged credit card price in case the order is
                cancelled or refused.

                Better You does not
                apply. Sale and discounts might be on selected items and for selected units of a particular product and
                if the selected
                discounted units are sold or are not available, then the discount would not apply to it even if new
                units of the same
                product are in stock. If you do not agree with the terms and conditions, then you must not use this
                website for any
                purpose. <br>
